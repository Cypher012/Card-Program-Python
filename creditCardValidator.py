# **Credit/Debit Card Validator**

# The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, most notably credit card numbers. Itâ€™s designed to detect accidental errors in digits, such as mistyped numbers. Here's how it works:
#
# 1. Remove any '-' or ' '|
# 2. Add all digits in the odd places from right to left
# 3. Double every second digit(even places) from right to left.
# (If result is a two-digit number,
# add the two-digit number together to get a single digit.)
# 4. Sum the totals of steps 2 & 3
# 5. If sum is divisible by 10, the credit card # is valid
